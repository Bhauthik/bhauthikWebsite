          <h4>Who can attend this course?</h4>
          <p align='justify'>
            Bhauthik's CSIR NET/JRF/GATE/JEST coaching preliminary aims ambitious MSc Physics students who dream for exciting research or professional teaching career. It doesn't matter whether you are an MSc passed-out student or a first/second-year student; even if you had a long gap after your MSc, you can attend this course as long as you have a strong determination to secure your future. All of your tutors in this course are well-qualified PhD holders from prestigious universities such as IIT Madras and NUS-Singapore, having a charismatic approach towards their students. </p>
      <h4>Bhauthik's offer</h4>
      <p align='justify'>
        Being proactive researchers, our tutors are practical executors of your text-book physics in their research on a day-to-day basis, thereby helping you to understand all those basic concepts in the best way possible. In your rewarding journey to your research career or the teaching profession, our tutors can become your perfect companions; not only until you clear your exams but also throughout your journey of life. In addition, there will be bonus classes on special topics with live simulations, motivation classes and webinars by researchers and scientists from different parts of the world.
      </p>
      <h4>Class timing</h4>
      <p align='justify'>
        We cover both undergrad and post-grad level physics during this course by including a maximum number of problems and solutions from each topic. We conduct four sessions a week, each consisting of 2 hours. The first hour will be committed to teaching the theoretical concepts and ideas, and the next hour will be dedicated to solving problems based on the covered topic of the day. Classes are scheduled for Mondays, Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays, from 7.00 PM to 9.00 PM (IST). After every class, an additional problem sheet will be distributed as an assignment. The solutions to the assignments will be provided in the upcoming class.       </p>
      <h4>Weekly online test-series</h4>
      <p align='justify'>
        We conduct online examination series every Sunday based on the topics covered in the past week. Bhauthik has developed this test-series to mimic the real-life experience during an online competitive exam. In addition to the weekly test-series, frequent revision exams will also be conducted. </p>
       <h4> Bhauthik predicts your performance in UGC NET/JRF/GATE/JEST</h4>
        <p align='justify'> At Bhauthik, we have exclusively developed advanced Machine Learning algorithms to predict the performance of students in the CSIR NET/JRF/GATE/JEST examinations. Such predictions (beta-stage) will help students to rectify their weak-points, thereby significantly boosting their chance to reserve the highest ranks.       </p>     
    <p align='justify'>Our friendly tutors and technical team members are always ready to clear your doubts asap. During this course, you will sit and learn with IITians by solving 1000+ problems and underlying concepts.</p>
